## 1. Introduction.
<img src="nuget.png" height="150">
NuGet (pronounced "New Get") is a free and open-source package manager designed for the Microsoft development platform (formerly known as NuPack). Since its introduction in 2010, NuGet has evolved into a larger ecosystem of tools and services. NuGet is distributed as a Visual Studio extension. Starting with Visual Studio 2012, NuGet comes pre-installed by default. NuGet is also integrated with SharpDevelop. NuGet can also be used from the command line and automated with scripts.
